- What is the difference between ***var*** and ***let***?
The scope of var is larger. The scope of let is constrained to the {} functions, where var can be accessed anywhere.
- What is the difference between **var** and ***const***?
Var can be reassigned where const cannot. The scope is also smaller for const.
- What is the difference between **let** and **const**?
Same scope, though let can be reassigned and const cannot.
- What is hoisting?
When the value of a variable can be accessed before it is actually declared in the code. Var is hoisted by the compiler to be declared before code is run regardless of where it is in the program.
